#### Description: An asthetic anime planner, i focused really on asthetic so all the features were changed multiple times...
> This is not a readme but rather me talking about various stuff lol the website can be easily navigated i dont think you need a manual for that i did the manual stuff in the last project so skipped this time......
## I love ai (wrote after project completion)
### learned what?
> ***Github*** basics yeah

>***Render*** and ***postgre SQL*** 
>Bunch of other small stuff (***node js ubuntu*** , ***gemini*** cli as claude was paid, and stuff but nm)

> i mean yeah coding is basically dubugging so now you debug more man i had multiple headaches it wasnt the best experience but okk

> the main benifit of ai is you can do things you cant for example i dont plan to become a web devloper but i was able to do right after cs50X that is the basic or more than basics i mean

> And yeah i ***shifted the website from local to web using render*** yeah....

>but it will ***expire in one month*** as PostgreSql need subscription

> There are many more feature i will implement through time to time(if not lazy that is)

>i love cursor so i spent some time downloading claude code, wow so easy to download it in windows, it was hell only to find out i need to buy token i thought it was free , me poor lol

>shifted to gemini cli it was hard to instsall as i already had the chat version anyway gemini suck right now to be honest


## Planning(Before project)
### Basic Ideas
I want to create a website using all the tools avlaible to me including ai, it is going to be a website with a sumbmission page were i can put new entries of anime  i watched than a preview page where i can see all the anime i sumbitted than a optional link where i can see more details about the anime if i put those details for example photos or detail overview of the anime or even some details about some special episodes offc it need to be super duper pretty so i wont mind totally stealing some beautifful formated webpages though rn i have doubts where to find such webpages might be easy if there was some website providing thoses pre made webpages i can use but lets see......
### Things i may need to build rn...
>Add page:- I should be able to add anime name, my rating, and a short thoughts about the anime, maybe the user can provide with date if they want otherwise current date, you can mark if this is sequel of a anime already in the list all these information stored in a csv file and there would be a link to a webpage where if the user wanted to put more details there will be link where he can put more details...
>Preview page:- Where i show the anime entries and if the user added more details there will be link to a diff url where he can see those details beautifully

>***Much more stuff but first lets implement this much***

# My worst mistake
### Cursor
Like can you imaine knowing cursor exist and not using it...
yes the cursor isnt not perfect but neither is chat gpt far better than copy and paste 
also i had to spend some days trying to fix the minimal bugs had to fix many manually as turns out ai cant fix the smallest bug they make like especially it was hell handling the image uploads as it was always accesing some wrong tables and stuff and filltering using ai was hell i had to fix many bugs manually. Like i spent a whole day just to see why image is not beign shown only to see that it was accesing url from anime_detail rather than from anime directly...
>the bugs i couldnt fix , i just deleted the feature tehee ;)
