# Anime Planner
## Planning
### Basic Ideas
I want to create a website using all the tools avlaible to me including ai, it is going to be a website with a sumbmission page were i can put new entries of anime  i watched than a preview page where i can see all the anime i sumbitted than a optional link where i can see more details about the anime if i put those details for example photos or detail overview of the anime or even some details about some special episodes offc it need to be super duper pretty so i wont mind totally stealing some beautifful formated webpages though rn i have doubts where to find such webpages might be easy if there was some website providing thoses pre made webpages i can use but lets see......
### Things i may need to build
>Add page:- I should be able to add anime name, my rating, and a short thoughts about the anime, maybe the user can provide with date if they want otherwise current date, you can mark if this is sequel of a anime already in the list all these information stored in a csv file and there would be a link to a webpage where if the user wanted to put more details there will be link where he can put more details...
>Preview page:- Where i show the anime entries and if the user added more details there will be link to a diff url where he can see those details beautifully

>***Much more stuff but first lets implement this much***
